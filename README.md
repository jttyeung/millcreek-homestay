### About the architecture

This repo contains an **[website](https://middleman-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)** that is customized off a template built by [Tom Rutgers](https://www.tomrutgers.nl/) using [Middleman](https://www.middlemanapp.com/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org).

**Middleman** is a static site generator using all the shortcuts and tools in modern web development. Check out [middlemanapp.com](http://middlemanapp.com/) for detailed tutorials, including a [getting started guide](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/getting-started/).

**Netlify CMS** is a CMS for static site generators. Give non-technical users a simple way to edit and add content to any site built with a static site generator.
