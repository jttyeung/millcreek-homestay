  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emmelinewang/">Emmeline</a> (she/her) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oreolard/">Joanne</a> (she/her) are the (COVID-vaccinated!) couple who own the townhome. They are two adventurous ladies who love to rock climb, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefatso_ul/">cook/bake</a>, and adventure outside in the countless beautiful areas that Utah has to offer. They also have three kitties named <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Bumi">Bumi</a>, <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Toph_Beifong">Toph</a>, and <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Appa">Appa</a> who are very friendly and outgoing (cuddles promised!).

  Emmeline and Joanne value a home environment that brings them peace and helps them feel rejuvenated, and they invite you to share this with them. Their ideal household is where everyone treats the space as their own home by cleaning up after themselves and voluntarily pitching in to keep the common spaces clean and tidy. They do not operate on a chore wheel, but this may be reconsidered should this system not work for the household needs.

  Emmeline and Joanne value open communication to keep a harmonious and peaceful household. If something isn't working, they'll bring it up early, use <a href="https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/learn-nonviolent-communication/">Nonviolent Communication</a>, and encourage guests to do the same.

  Emmeline and Joanne value the conservation of resources. It's habitual to turn off anything that's not currently in use: lights when they leave the room, heating/cooling when they leave the space, no excessive running water, etc. They try as best as they can to not create more trash than necessary by reusing grocery bags, recycling, and preventing food waste. They are acutely aware that we only have one earth, and they value those who also respect our Mother.
  
  Emmeline, Joanne, Bumi, Toph, and Appa look forward to meeting you and hope you enjoy your stay at Millcreek Homestay!
