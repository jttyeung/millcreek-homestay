  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emmelinewang/">Emmeline</a> (she/her) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oreolard/">Joanne</a> (she/her) are the (COVID-vaccinated!) couple who own the townhome. They are two adventurous ladies who love to rock climb, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefatso_ul/">cook/bake</a>, and adventure outside in the countless beautiful areas that Utah has to offer. They also have a kitty named Bumi, who is very friendly and outgoing (cuddles to be promised!). Emmeline and Joanne value cleanliness and hope that any roommate who stays with them will treat the space as their own home too.
  
  Emmeline, Joanne, and Bumi look forward to meeting you and hope you enjoy your stay at Millcreek Homestay!
