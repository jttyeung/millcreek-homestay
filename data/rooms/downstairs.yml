  This lower level room is a basement room with a full sized traditional Japanese style tatami bed/mattress (with an optional mattress topper) and has a detached, private bathroom. It shares a wall with the garage and it's the only room on this level for maximum privacy during your stay. As a north facing room it gets soft morning light, but with a large full-sized window (atypical of most basement units), it still receives ample lighting throughout the day.
